## [0.1.0] — 2025-12-06

### Added
- Initial public release of the project.
- Project overview and theoretical scope described in `README.md`.

  - CC BY 4.0 for theoretical documentation.
  - MIT License for simulation code structure.

### Notes
- This version represents a conceptual and exploratory stage of the model.
- No numerical simulations are included yet.
- Future versions will introduce a formal mathematical description
  and GPU-based numerical experiments.

## [0.2.0] — 2025-12-10

### Added
- Introduced the Emergent Stability Framework (ESF) as the conceptual basis of the model.
- Added qualitative interpretation of electrons as locally stable configurations.
- Added interpretation of photons as propagating stability redistribution modes.
- Published LaTeX source (`theory-v0.tex`) for the theoretical document.

### Updated
- Revised `theory-v0.pdf` to include ESF and microphysical interpretation.

## [0.2.1] — 2025-12-12
