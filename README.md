# Emergent Phase-Field Bubble Cosmology

Author: Oleksandr Khymych  
Initial public release: 2025-12-06

## Overview

This repository presents an early-stage theoretical framework and numerical exploration
of a bubble-like interpretation of cosmological dynamics, based on phase-field models
and fluid-like interactions.

The central idea is that structures resembling expanding or contracting “universes”
can emerge as stable patterns within a continuous medium, governed by local interaction
rules rather than explicitly postulated long-range forces.

This work is presented as a **toy model** and **conceptual framework**, not as a complete
or experimentally verified theory.

This work is developed within the **Emergent Stability Framework (ESF)** —
an ontological approach in which particles, fields, and cosmological structures
are interpreted as stable or metastable configurations of an underlying
continuous medium, rather than as fundamental point-like objects.
